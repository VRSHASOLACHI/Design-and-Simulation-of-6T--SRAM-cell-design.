# Design-and-Simulation-of-6T--SRAM-cell-design.
The SRAM memory architecture is structured around the fundamental unit known as the SRAM cell. This cell, typically a 6T configuration, holds a bit of data, representing either a 1 or 0. The architecture is designed for efficient data storage and retrieval, with specific components contributing to its functionality.
